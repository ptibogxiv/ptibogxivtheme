## Features of this theme

* Simple, intuitive, clean code with autoupdater from our github's releases.

* Bootstrap, theme CSS and JS, functions and loops are organized into different folders.

* **Bootstrap 4.4.1** CSS and JS enqueued with several color scheme with Bootswatch

* **Popper 1.16.0** JS enqueued. Because Bootstrap popovers and tooltips need it.

* **Font Awesome 5.12.0** enqueued.

* **Navbar with dropdowns (child menus)**

* Sidebar-widget-area is optional. If no widgets, then the sidebar will not be shown (main column automatically becomes full width).

* A starter CSS theme – `/theme/css/ptibogxivtheme.css`, enqueued. (Note: do not put your styles in `styles.css`.)

* WordPress menu and WordPress search form in the Bootstrap 4 `.navbar` (Note: Bootstrap 4 navbar dropdowns supports only two levels of menu links (no sub-sub menus).

* Bootstrap pagination for blog index and blog category pages.

* Bootstrap pagination for posts/pages if split over a series of 'pages'.

* Visual editor stylesheet – into which the same Bootstrap 4 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typpography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, and you can use Bootstrap CSS in the editor – but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.
