*Version 1.7.4*

[https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st)

------------------

**b4st is a simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 4.**

> **NOTE:** Bootstrap v4.0.0-beta.2 is being called from `https://cdnjs.com/libraries/twitter-bootstrap`

## Features of b4st

* Simple, intuitive, clean code.

* Bootstrap, theme CSS and JS, functions and loops are organized into different folders.

* **Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta.2** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) CSS and JS enqueued.

* **Popper 1.12.3** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) JS enqueued. Because Bootstrap popovers and tooltips need it.

* **jQuery 3.2.1** enqueued, (served by cdnjs.com CDN),

* **Font Awesome 4.7.0** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) enqueued.

* **Modernizr 2.8.3** (served by cdnjs.com CDN) enqueued.

* **Navbar with dropdowns (child menus)** – a [custom walker nav menu class](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/b4st/blob/master/functions/navbar.php) has been built to handle the dropdowns.

* Sidebar-widget-area is optional. If no widgets, then the sidebar will not be shown (main column automatically becomes full width).

* A starter CSS theme – `/theme/css/b4st.css`, enqueued. (Note: do not put your styles in `styles.css`.)

* WordPress menu and WordPress search form in the Bootstrap 4 `.navbar` (Note: Bootstrap 4 navbar dropdowns supports only two levels of menu links (no sub-sub menus).

* Bootstrap pagination for blog index and blog category pages.

* Bootstrap pagination for posts/pages if split over a series of 'pages'.

* Visual editor stylesheet – into which the same Bootstrap 4 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typpography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, and you can use Bootstrap CSS in the editor – but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.

* [UNLICENCE](http://unlicense.org) (open source).

Inspired by Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), Atomic Boot Pug is comprised of a set of Bootstrap 4 docs demo snippets (tranformed into [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) mixins) reorganized into a starter styleguide.

Just a little something to help you kick off your next project. :-)
